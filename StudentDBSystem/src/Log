[To-do:
[URGENT: refix panel layout so it's more fluid when resizing the application] 
1)Add JTable to the right panel and include columns by labels existing.
2)Add actionlistener to all buttons.
3)Create database and connect the database to the textfields to store, and once you click "add new" it will store it into the database and vice versa with the other buttons.]
